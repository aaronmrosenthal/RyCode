# Security Enhancement Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate to the new security features in RyCode with encryption at rest and file integrity verification.

## Overview

RyCode now supports:
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest** - AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ **File Integrity Verification** - SHA-256 checksums to detect tampering
- ✅ **HSTS Headers** - Force HTTPS in production
- ✅ **Enhanced Plugin Sandbox** - Resource limits and stricter isolation

## Encryption at Rest

### Setup

1. **Generate an encryption key:**
   ```bash
   bun run packages/rycode/src/index.ts generate-key
   ```

2. **Set the environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-generated-key>"
   ```

   Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
   ```bash
   echo 'export RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-key>"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Verify encryption is active:**
   ```bash
   # When you store auth credentials, you should see:
   # "auth data written with encryption and integrity"
   ```

### What Gets Encrypted

With `RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set, the following data is automatically encrypted:

- **Authentication credentials** (`~/.local/share/rycode/auth.json`)
  - OAuth tokens (refresh, access)
  - API keys
  - Well-known tokens

- **Future: Session data** (planned)
- **Future: Plugin configurations** (planned)

### Backward Compatibility

The system is **fully backward compatible**:

- ✅ **Without encryption key**: Data stored as plaintext (with warning)
- ✅ **With encryption key**: New data encrypted, old data readable
- ✅ **Migration**: Automatic on first write after setting key

### Manual Migration

To immediately migrate all existing data to encrypted format:

```typescript
import { Auth } from "./auth"

// After setting RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
const migrated = await Auth.migrateToEncrypted()
console.log(`Migrated ${migrated} credentials to encrypted storage`)
```

## File Integrity Verification

### How It Works

All sensitive files are now wrapped with SHA-256 checksums:

```
<64-char-hex-checksum>:<encrypted-or-plaintext-data>
```

On read, the system:
1. Extracts the checksum
2. Computes checksum of data
3. Verifies using constant-time comparison
4. Throws `IntegrityError` if mismatch

### What's Protected

- ✅ Authentication data (`auth.json`)
- Future: Session storage
- Future: Configuration files

### Handling Integrity Errors

If you see an `IntegrityError`, it means:
- File was manually edited
- Disk corruption occurred
- Malicious tampering detected

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Backup the file
cp ~/.local/share/rycode/auth.json ~/.local/share/rycode/auth.json.backup

# Re-authenticate to regenerate file
rycode auth <provider>
```

## HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

### Automatic Behavior

HSTS headers are **automatically added** when:
- Connection is HTTPS (detected via `X-Forwarded-Proto` header or URL scheme)
- In production environment

**Header sent:**
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

This forces browsers to:
- Always use HTTPS for your RyCode instance (for 1 year)
- Apply to all subdomains
- Be eligible for browser HSTS preload lists

### Development Mode

HSTS is **NOT sent** on HTTP connections to avoid breaking local development.

## Enhanced Plugin Sandbox

### New Security Limits

Plugins now have enforced resource limits:

```typescript
{
  timeout: 30_000,           // 30 seconds max execution
  maxMemoryMB: 256,          // 256 MB max memory
  maxCpuTimeSeconds: 10,     // 10 seconds max CPU
  allowNetwork: false,       // Network disabled by default
  strictMode: true           // No eval, no dynamic require
}
```

### Upgrading Plugins

If your plugin needs more resources, configure in `.rycode/config.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "my-plugin": {
      "sandbox": {
        "timeout": 60000,
        "maxMemoryMB": 512,
        "allowNetwork": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Checklist

### Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] **Set RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY** environment variable
- [ ] **Migrate existing data** to encrypted format
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS** (HSTS will activate automatically)
- [ ] **Review plugin permissions** in config
- [ ] **Set restrictive file permissions** (`chmod 600` on sensitive files)
- [ ] **Enable rate limiting** in server config
- [ ] **Configure security monitoring** webhooks

### Development Environment

For local development:

- [ ] **Optional**: Set RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY for testing encryption
- [ ] **Keep HTTP** (HSTS won't interfere)
- [ ] **Use development server config** (bypass localhost auth)

## Configuration Examples

### Minimum Security (Development)

```json
{
  "server": {
    "require_auth": false,
    "rate_limit": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Maximum Security (Production)

```json
{
  "server": {
    "require_auth": true,
    "api_keys": ["<hashed-api-key>"],
    "rate_limit": {
      "enabled": true,
      "limit": 100,
      "window_ms": 60000
    }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "*": {
      "sandbox": {
        "timeout": 30000,
        "maxMemoryMB": 256,
        "allowNetwork": false,
        "strictMode": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable required"

**Cause**: Trying to read encrypted data without the key set.

**Fix**:
```bash
export RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-key>"
```

### "Data integrity check failed"

**Cause**: File checksum doesn't match (tampering or corruption).

**Fix**:
1. Backup the file
2. Delete corrupted file
3. Re-authenticate or re-configure

### "Failed to decrypt data - wrong key"

**Cause**: Using different encryption key than when data was encrypted.

**Fix**:
- Ensure `RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` matches the key used to encrypt
- If key lost, delete encrypted files and re-authenticate

### HSTS Not Working

**Verify**:
```bash
curl -I https://your-rycode-instance.com
# Should see: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

**Common issues**:
- Connection is HTTP (HSTS only sent on HTTPS)
- Proxy not forwarding `X-Forwarded-Proto` header

**Fix**:
```nginx
# Nginx proxy configuration
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

## Performance Impact

### Encryption Overhead

- **Encryption**: ~1-2ms per operation for typical data sizes
- **Decryption**: ~1-2ms per operation
- **Key Derivation**: ~100ms on first use (cached afterward)

**Recommendation**: Negligible impact for typical usage. Encryption is **worth it** for security.

### Integrity Verification Overhead

- **Checksum Computation**: <1ms for files <10MB
- **Verification**: <1ms (constant-time comparison)

**Recommendation**: No noticeable impact. Always enabled for sensitive data.

## Key Management Best Practices

### Generating Strong Keys

```typescript
import { SecureStorage } from "./storage/secure-storage"

// Generate cryptographically secure key
const key = SecureStorage.generateKey()
console.log("Store securely:", key)
```

### Storing Keys Securely

**✅ DO:**
- Store in environment variables
- Use system keychain/secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Use `.env` files (git-ignored)
- Encrypt keys at rest on disk

**❌ DON'T:**
- Commit to git
- Store in plaintext config files
- Share via insecure channels (email, Slack, etc.)
- Reuse across environments

### Key Rotation

To rotate encryption key:

1. **Generate new key**:
   ```bash
   NEW_KEY=$(bun run packages/rycode/src/index.ts generate-key)
   ```

2. **Decrypt with old key, re-encrypt with new**:
   ```typescript
   process.env.RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY = OLD_KEY
   const data = await Auth.all()

   process.env.RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY = NEW_KEY
   for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(data)) {
     await Auth.set(key, value) // Re-encrypts with new key
   }
   ```

3. **Update environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export RYCODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$NEW_KEY"
   ```

4. **Securely delete old key**
