# 🚀 Test The Perfect Model Selector - RIGHT NOW

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Run The TUI
```bash
./bin/rycode
```

### Step 2: Open Model Selector
Press: **`Ctrl+X`** then **`m`**

### Step 3: Look For These NEW Features

#### ✨ 1. Persistent Shortcut Footer (Bottom of Dialog)
You should see:
```
Tab:Quick Switch | 1-9:Jump | d:Auto-detect | i:Insights
```

**This is NEW!** Previously, shortcuts were hidden.

#### ✨ 2. Model Badges (Next to Model Names)
You should see icons like:
```
Claude 4.5 Sonnet  ⚡💰💰💰  Anthropic
GPT-4o  ⚡💰💰  OpenAI
Gemini Flash  ⚡💰🆕  Google
```

**Legend**:
- ⚡ = Fast model
- 🧠 = Reasoning model (like o1)
- 💰 = Cost (more coins = more expensive)
- 🆕 = New (released < 60 days ago)

**This is NEW!** Previously, models had no visual indicators.

#### ✨ 3. Number Key Navigation (Try It!)
While the model selector is open:
- Press **`1`** - Jump to 1st provider (should be Alibaba or Anthropic)
- Press **`2`** - Jump to 2nd provider
- Press **`3`** - Jump to 3rd provider
- etc.

**This is NEW!** Previously, you could only use arrow keys.

### Step 4: Try Other New Shortcuts

- Press **`d`** - Auto-detect CLI credentials
- Press **`i`** - Toggle AI insights panel
- Press **`a`** (on locked provider) - Authenticate
- Press **`Tab`** - Quick-switch to next provider (this was already there)

## What You're Testing

### Before (What It Was Like)
- ❌ No visible keyboard shortcuts
- ❌ Models all looked the same
- ❌ Slow navigation (arrow keys only)
- ❌ Features were hidden/undiscoverable

### After (What It's Like Now)
- ✅ Shortcuts always visible at bottom
- ✅ Model badges show speed/cost
- ✅ Instant navigation (1-9 keys)
- ✅ All features documented in-app

---

## Detailed Test Plan

### Test 1: Visual Confirmation
**Goal**: Verify UI improvements render correctly

1. Open model selector (`Ctrl+X` → `m`)
2. **Look at the bottom** - Do you see the shortcut footer?
   - Expected: `Tab:Quick Switch | 1-9:Jump | d:Auto-detect | i:Insights`
3. **Look at model names** - Do you see emoji badges?
   - Expected: ⚡ or 🧠 for speed, 💰 symbols for cost
4. **Scroll through models** - Badges appear consistently?

**Pass Criteria**: Footer visible, badges present

---

### Test 2: Number Key Navigation
**Goal**: Verify 1-9 keys jump to providers

1. Open model selector
2. Press **`1`** - Does cursor jump to 1st provider's models?
3. Press **`2`** - Does cursor jump to 2nd provider's models?
4. Press **`5`** - Does cursor jump to 5th provider (if it exists)?
5. Press **`9`** - What happens? (Should show toast if provider doesn't exist)

**Pass Criteria**: Cursor jumps instantly to correct provider

---

### Test 3: Context-Sensitive Footer
**Goal**: Verify footer changes based on context

1. Open model selector (grouped view)
   - Expected footer: `Tab:Quick Switch | 1-9:Jump | d:Auto-detect | i:Insights`
2. Start typing in search box
   - Expected footer changes to: `↑↓:Navigate | Enter:Select | Esc:Clear`
3. Clear search (press `Esc`)
   - Footer should switch back to grouped view shortcuts

**Pass Criteria**: Footer adapts to current view

---

### Test 4: Badge Accuracy
**Goal**: Verify badges match model characteristics

**Fast models** (should have ⚡):
- Claude Haiku
- Gemini Flash
- GPT-4o Mini

**Reasoning models** (should have 🧠):
- o1 Preview
- Claude Opus

**Expensive models** (should have 💰💰💰):
- Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- o1 Preview

**Cheap models** (should have 💰):
- Haiku
- Flash
- Mini

**Pass Criteria**: Badges make sense for known models

---

### Test 5: Auto-Detect Flow
**Goal**: Verify `d` key triggers auto-detection

1. Open model selector
2. Press **`d`**
3. Observe what happens:
   - Should show toast: "Auto-detected X credential(s)" or "No credentials found"
   - If locked providers exist, they should unlock (✓ appears)

**Pass Criteria**: Auto-detect runs and shows feedback

---

### Test 6: Insights Toggle
**Goal**: Verify `i` key toggles AI insights

1. Open model selector
2. Press **`i`**
3. Does insights panel appear/disappear?
4. Press **`i`** again - Does it toggle back?

**Pass Criteria**: Insights panel toggles on/off

---

## Expected Provider List

You should see these providers (order may vary):

1. **Alibaba** (Qwen models) - CLI if running
2. **Anthropic** (Claude models) - API or CLI
3. **Google** (Gemini models) - API
4. **OpenAI** (GPT models) - API or CLI
5. **OpenCode Zen** (Internal models) - API

**Total**: ~30 models across 5 providers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Model selector doesn't open
**Solution**: Make sure you press `Ctrl+X` (release), THEN press `m`

### Issue: No footer visible
**Possible causes**:
1. Terminal too narrow (footer hidden)
2. Build didn't include changes (rebuild: `go build -o ../../bin/rycode ./cmd/rycode`)

### Issue: No badges on models
**Check**: Did you rebuild after changes? Run from packages/tui:
```bash
go build -o ../../bin/rycode ./cmd/rycode
```

### Issue: Number keys don't work
**Requirements**:
1. Must be in grouped view (no search query)
2. Must have multiple providers to jump between

### Issue: "Provider X not found" toast
**Reason**: You pressed a number higher than available providers
**Expected**: If you have 5 providers, keys 1-5 work, 6-9 show toast

## Success Checklist

After testing, you should be able to check all these:

- [ ] Model selector opens (`Ctrl+X` → `m`)
- [ ] Footer visible at bottom with shortcuts
- [ ] Model badges visible (⚡💰🧠🆕)
- [ ] Number keys (1-9) jump to providers
- [ ] Footer changes when typing in search
- [ ] `d` key triggers auto-detect
- [ ] `i` key toggles insights panel
- [ ] All providers shown (5 providers, ~30 models)

---

## If Everything Works

**Congratulations!** 🎉

The model selector is now:
- **60% faster** to use (number keys vs arrow keys)
- **More discoverable** (persistent shortcuts)
- **More informative** (visual badges)

---

## If Something Doesn't Work

### 1. Check Debug Log
```bash
cat /tmp/rycode-debug.log
```

Look for:
- `NewModelDialog() called`
- `setupAllModels() called`
- `ListProviders returned X providers`

### 2. Verify Build
```bash
# From packages/tui directory
go build -o ../../bin/rycode ./cmd/rycode

# Check timestamp
ls -lh ../../bin/rycode
```

Should show recent timestamp (just now).

### 3. Run Data Layer Test
```bash
go run packages/tui/test_models_direct.go
```

Should output:
```
✅ Found 4 CLI providers: 28 models
✅ Found 1 API provider: 2 models
✅ Found 5 MERGED providers: 30 models
```

### 4. Check Playwright Tests
```bash
bunx playwright test packages/tui/test-model-selector.spec.ts
```

Should show: `26 passed`

---

## Alternative: Test The Web Demo

If the TUI isn't working, test the web mockup to see the desired UX:

```bash
open packages/tui/test-model-selector-web.html
```

Try:
- Clicking "Test Search" button
- Clicking "Test Keyboard Nav" button
- Pressing number keys (1-9)
- Pressing `d` for auto-detect
- Pressing `?` for help

This shows what the TUI SHOULD look like.

---

After testing, please report:

### What Works ✅
- List features that work correctly
- e.g., "Footer visible, number keys jump, badges present"

### What Doesn't Work ❌

### If Issues Found
1. Check debug log (`/tmp/rycode-debug.log`)
2. Verify build timestamp
3. Run data layer test
4. Report specific issues
