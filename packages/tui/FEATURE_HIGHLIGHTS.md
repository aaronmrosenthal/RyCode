**Example:**
```
Task: Code review
Priority: Quality
Time: 2pm (work hours)

Recommendation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Score: 95/100
Reasoning: Best for code analysis with detailed feedback.
           Work hours detected - prioritizing quality over cost.
Cost: $0.015 per 1K tokens
Speed: Medium (2-4s)
Quality: High
```
