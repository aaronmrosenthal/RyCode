## 🔍 The Three Critical Gaps

### GAP #1: Static vs. Dynamic (MOST CRITICAL)

**toolkit-cli.com:**
```
Title: "Multi-Agent IDE"
↓ (2 seconds later)
Title: "Multi-Agent IDE"  (colors shifted green→cyan)
↓ (2 seconds later)
Title: "Multi-Agent IDE"  (colors shifted cyan→blue)
```

**RyCode v2.0:**
```
Title: "RyCode AI Assistant"
↓ (forever)
Title: "RyCode AI Assistant"  (same green, never changes)
```

**Impact:** Users perceive it as "nice but static" instead of "living and breathing"

**Fix:** Animated gradient system (Phase 1.1)

---

### GAP #2: Generic AI vs. Branded Presence

**toolkit-cli.com:**
```
[Blue Orb] Agent thinking... (Claude-specific blue)
[Purple Orb] Agent thinking... (GPT-specific purple)
```

**RyCode v2.0:**
```
AI • just now
Message content...  (all green, no personality)
```

**Impact:** AI feels generic instead of having distinct personality

**Fix:** Provider-specific branding (Phase 1.3)

---

### GAP #3: Boring Streaming vs. Mesmerizing Visualization

**toolkit-cli.com:**
```
⠹ Agent processing... [animated spinner]
   Tokens flowing: ███▒▒▒ [live progress]
```

**RyCode v2.0:**
```
...  (static three dots)
```

**Impact:** Watching AI stream is boring instead of engaging

**Fix:** Advanced streaming visualization (Phase 1.4)
