## 🚀 Next Steps

### Maintain Organization
1. Keep active work in appropriate phase directories
2. Move completed phases to historical when done
3. Update README files when adding new documentation

### Future Improvements
1. Add architecture documentation as needed
2. Create planning docs for new features
3. Update security docs after audits
