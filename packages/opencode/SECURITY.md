## üéØ Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use Strict Mode in Production**
   ```jsonc
   {
     "plugin_security": {
       "mode": "strict",
       "verifyIntegrity": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use CLI Commands for Plugin Management**
   ```bash
   # Check if a plugin is trusted
   rycode plugin:check my-plugin 1.0.0

   # Generate hash for a plugin
   rycode plugin:hash /path/to/plugin.js

   # Verify plugin integrity
   rycode plugin:verify /path/to/plugin.js --hash <expected-hash>

   # View security audit log
   rycode plugin:audit
   ```

2. **Pin Plugin Versions**
   ```jsonc
   {
     "plugin_security": {
       "trustedPlugins": [{
         "name": "my-plugin",
         "versions": ["1.2.3"]  // Exact version
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Enable Integrity Verification**
   ```jsonc
   {
     "plugin_security": {
       "verifyIntegrity": true,
       "trustedPlugins": [{
         "hash": "sha256-hash-here"
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Review Plugin Capabilities**
   - Only grant minimum required permissions
   - Avoid `shell: true` and `env: true` unless absolutely necessary

5. **Monitor Audit Logs**
   ```bash
   rycode plugin:audit
   ```

### For Plugin Developers

1. **Minimize Capabilities**
   - Request only the permissions your plugin needs
   - Document why each capability is required

2. **Validate All Inputs**
   - Never trust user-provided data
   - Sanitize file paths, URLs, and commands

3. **Follow Secure Coding Practices**
   - Avoid eval(), Function(), or dynamic code execution
   - Use parameterized commands, not string concatenation
   - Validate and sanitize all outputs

4. **Publish Source Code**
   - Make your plugin open source for transparency
   - Accept security audits and bug reports

5. **Sign Your Releases**
   - Provide GPG signatures for your packages
   - Include SHA-256 hashes in release notes

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Plugin Sandboxing**
   - Current implementation uses capability-based restrictions
   - Full process isolation not yet implemented
   - **Mitigation:** Use strict mode and only trust verified plugins

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Plugins may include vulnerable dependencies
   - **Mitigation:** Regularly run `bun audit` and update dependencies

3. **AI Prompt Injection**
   - Malicious files could contain prompts that trick the AI
   - **Mitigation:** Review AI-generated commands before execution

### Planned Improvements

- [x] **Process-level plugin sandboxing using worker threads** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** (October 2025)
- [ ] Automated CVE scanning for plugin dependencies
- [x] **GPG signature verification for plugins** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** (October 2025)
- [x] **Plugin registry with verified hashes** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** (October 2025)
- [ ] Rate limiting for API requests
- [ ] Network request filtering and monitoring

**Progress: 3 of 6 completed (50%)**
