# 🚀 The Killer TUI of the Future: Vision & Roadmap

## Vision Statement
We're not building just another terminal UI. We're building the **most intelligent, context-aware, and delightful development interface** that developers don't even know they need yet.

---

## 🎯 The Paradigm Shifts

### 1. **Predictive Intelligence Layer**
#### What developers don't know they're missing:
- **Pre-emptive Context Loading**: AI predicts what files you'll need next based on conversation flow
- **Smart Diff Previews**: Before you even ask, show likely changes in ghosted text
- **Conversation Branching**: Visualize alternate conversation paths like a git tree
- **Ambient Awareness**: Detect when you're stuck (repeated edits, long pauses) and offer help

**Implementation Ideas:**
```typescript
// Predictive file loading
interface PredictiveContext {
  nextLikelyFiles: string[]      // Based on conversation pattern
  confidenceScore: number         // How sure we are
  preloadInBackground: boolean    // Load without blocking
  ghostPreview: boolean           // Show dimmed predictions
}

// Conversation branching
interface ConversationTree {
  branches: Branch[]
  currentBranch: string
  mergePoints: MergePoint[]
  timeTravel: (branchId: string) => void
}
```

---

### 2. **Multi-Dimensional View System**
#### Beyond single-pane terminals:

**Split Reality Views:**
- 📊 **Code View**: Syntax-highlighted, live-updating diffs
- 🧠 **Thought View**: AI reasoning process (collapsible thinking blocks)
- 📈 **Metrics View**: Token usage, response time, context window fill
- 🌳 **Tree View**: File structure with live change indicators
- 🔍 **Search View**: Semantic code search with AI explanations
- 📝 **Notes View**: Persistent scratchpad synced with conversation

**Adaptive Layout Engine:**
```go
type ViewportStrategy string

const (
    FocusMode    ViewportStrategy = "focus"     // Single view, max space
    CodeMode     ViewportStrategy = "code"      // Code + chat side-by-side
    DebugMode    ViewportStrategy = "debug"     // Multi-pane with metrics
    ReviewMode   ViewportStrategy = "review"    // Diff-focused with timeline
    ExploreMode  ViewportStrategy = "explore"   // Tree + search + chat
)

// Auto-switch based on context
func (a *App) AutoAdjustLayout(context ConversationContext) ViewportStrategy {
    if context.IsDebugging {
        return DebugMode
    }
    if context.HasLargeDiff {
        return ReviewMode
    }
    // ... intelligent switching
}
```

---

### 3. **Temporal Navigation & Time Travel**
#### Features developers don't know they need:

- **Conversation Timeline Scrubbing**: Drag through conversation history like a video scrubber
- **State Snapshots**: Auto-capture before major changes (like git but for conversations)
- **Undo with Context**: Don't just undo—see *why* you made that change
- **Parallel Universe Mode**: Try multiple approaches simultaneously, merge the best

**UI Concepts:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ◄ ═══════●═══════●═══●═══════════●══════════► │
│   ^       ^       ^   ^           ^            │
│   │       │       │   │           └─ Now       │
│   │       │       │   └─ Branch point          │
│   │       │       └─ Major refactor            │
│   │       └─ Bug introduced                    │
│   └─ Session start                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
